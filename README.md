# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge

In this challenge, data for an investment bank was analyzed to see if cryptocurrencies to be prospectively offered to clients of the bank could be classified into categories. Since there was no known classification system, an unsupervised machine learning approach was required. After data preparation, PCA, t-SNE and K Means models of classifications were used to determine if cryptocurrencies could be clustered into distinct categores. 

The cryptocurrencies can be clustered into 4 clusters. As seen in our elbow curve, five clusters would be overfitting since there is very little inertia decrease from 4 to 5 clusters. Two or three clusters would be an underfit, since there is still a large amount of decrease in inertia from 2 to 3 clusters and again from 3 to 4 clusters.
